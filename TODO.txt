OK - new terminology: participant, tournament, round, strike, challenge, question-answer
OK - show a log of failed challenges
	OK - save in domain model
	OK - layout
	OK - give unique ID for participants
	OK - use the ID in showing that participant's details
OK - load challenges from a directory
	OK - find out how to do it - eval or something?
	OK - reload before polling
OK - trim reponses from participants to ignore trailing newlines
OK - handle failures form poller
	OK - fix: polling crashes if malformed URL, or if service respondes with garbage
OK - poll servers automatically, many times per second, infinite loop
	OK - one poller thread per server
	OK - the polling in the poller thread
OK - calculate the score automatically, in 1 minute ticks
	OK - start a timer
	OK - reload challenges in the beginning of a round
- start the application explicitly in main instead of on loading
	!!- replacement logic in app
		OK - wrap all the refs into an object
		OK - registering participants
		OK - scheduling the starting of new rounds
		OK - starting new rounds
		OK - saving and loading application state
		OK - scheduling the polling of participants; on register
		!! - polling participants
		- replace controller with app
	- load app state in main if state file exists
	- do a controlled start of the pollers after loading from file; on start
	- participant/id-sequence isn't persisted; get next ID from tournament
- participant polling: sleep on error to avoid 100% CPU usage
- optimize memory usage, keep only the last N events in memory (else would have to poll less often)
- challenges: lorem ipsum: trim dot and comma
- make parsing easier; separate operator and operands by newline?
- better score calculation rules
	- take challenge points into consideration
	- use the points of the highest hit below the lowest miss
	- don't poll harder challenges when an easier challenge fails
- show score accumulation history
	- save score for each tick as [timestamp score]
	- calculate total score from the history
	- print the history as text
	- visualize the history as graph (find a JS graph library)
- better graphics
