	- start a timer
	- reload challenges in the beginning of a round
- make parsing easier; separate operator and operands by newline?
- better score calculation rules
	- take challenge points into consideration
	- use the points of the highest hit below the lowest miss
- show score accumulation history
	- save score for each tick as [timestamp score]
