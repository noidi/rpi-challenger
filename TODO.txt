OK - scrolling a full participants details page is hard, create section links
OK - check that there is a http server at the url on registration
- one of the participants (HKI 4.12.2012) used an obscure Python web server which killed the participant poller (bug with the http client?)
	- reproduce the issue and fix the immediate problem
	- make polling more failure resistant, perhaps restart the pollers periodically and recreate the http client
- split challenges module to challenge-fn and challenge
- allow challenges to return non-string answers, stringify automatically
- use a DB for persistence
	- evaluate OrientDB
- new game ideas?
	- multiplayer AI game based on http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/battle-city
