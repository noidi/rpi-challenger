OK - trim reponses from participants to ignore trailing newlines
OK - handle failures form poller
	OK - fix: polling crashes if malformed URL, or if service respondes with garbage
OK - poll servers automatically, many times per second, infinite loop
	OK - one poller thread per server

- make parsing easier; separate operator and operands by newline?
- better score calculation rules
	- take challenge points into consideration
	- use the points of the highest hit below the lowest miss
	- don't poll harder challenges when an easier challenge fails
- show score accumulation history
	- save score for each tick as [timestamp score]
	- calculate total score from the history
	- print the history as text
	- visualize the history as graph (find a JS graph library)
- better graphics
